I have created a CV based on html and css only. 
So creating a CV (Curriculum Vitae) in HTML and CSS involves structuring the document using HTML and then styling it using CSS. Here's a basic breakdown of the functionality and elements used:-

i. HTML Structure:
   
 <html>:- Defines the root of the HTML document.
<head>:- Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to CSS stylesheets.
<body>: Contains the content of the document.
<header>: Typically includes your name, contact information, and possibly a brief introduction.
<main>: Houses the main content of the CV, such as work experience, education, skills, etc.
<section>: Used to group related content together, such as work experience, education, and skills sections.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as an individual job position or educational qualification.
<ul> and <li>: Used for unordered lists, such as lists of skills or achievements.
<p>: Represents a paragraph of text, commonly used for descriptions or summaries.

2. CSS Styling:

Selectors: Target HTML elements to apply styles.
Properties: Define the appearance of elements, such as font size, color, margin, padding, etc.
Classes and IDs: Used to apply styles to specific elements or groups of elements.
Layout: Utilize CSS Grid or Flexbox to create a responsive layout for the CV, ensuring it looks good on various devices and screen sizes.
Typography: Style fonts, sizes, and weights to improve readability.
Colors and Backgrounds: Choose appropriate colors and backgrounds to enhance the visual appeal of the CV.
Box Model: Utilize properties like margin, padding, border, and width to control the spacing and layout of elements.
Responsive Design: Use media queries to adjust the layout and styling based on the device's screen size.

3. Functionality:

Accessibility: Ensure the CV is accessible to users with disabilities by following best practices for HTML semantics and providing alternative text for images.
Responsiveness: Make sure the CV is responsive and displays well on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Print Styles: Create styles specifically for printing to ensure the CV looks good when printed on paper.
Interactivity (optional): Add interactivity using JavaScript, such as interactive buttons or collapsible sections, but this is not usually necessary for a basic CV.

By combining HTML for structure and CSS for styling, you can create a visually appealing and functional CV that effectively showcases your qualifications and experience to potential employers.
